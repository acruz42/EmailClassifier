Q: "What are the GA opportunities?"

A: The department selects excellent applicants to give them teaching assistantships (TA). We will make the decisions in April for applications that we received in the Spring semesters and in November for applications that we received in the Fall semester. If you are not selected to get TA, you are welcome to contact department faculty members for a potential graduate research assistantship (RA). Even you are not offered TA/RA in the first semester, both graduate teaching and research positions are possible in future semesters if you show strong academic performance.
