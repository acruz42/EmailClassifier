Q: "How many years/semesters are needed to finish my degree?"

A: The degree requirements can be found from <ahref="https://catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/arts-sciences/computer-science/#degreestext">https://catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/arts-sciences/computer-science/#degreestext</a>. To get a degree, you need to finish the required courses and the total number of credits. Thus, the time depends on you. For example, the Masterâ€™s in Computer Science degree requires 33 credits. If you take 9 credits per semester, then you will need at least 4 semesters to finish your degree. If you need to take English courses or other deficiency courses, the time will be longer.
