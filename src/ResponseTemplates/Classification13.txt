Q: Your question was classfied as: "I got a D grade in a graduate course. How does it affect my GPA? Will it be counted as graduate credit?"

A: A D-grade course will be used in your GPA calculation, thus it affects your GPA. However, a D-grade course will NOT be counted towards your graduate program. For example, if you get a D in C S 510, which is a required course for your Masterâ€™s program. In order for it to be counted for your program, you need to retake it and get a higher grade.
