Q: "How do I transfer graduate credits from other universities?"

A: All the course credit transfer must be requested at the time of arrival. If you get a grade lower than B, your course credit cannot be transferred. If you get a grade of B or above B, you need to show the course syllabus to the department graduate advisor. The department graduate advisor decides whether your course credits can be transferred. If the graduate advisor cannot make the decision, the graduate advisor will contact the professors who teach those courses. These professors may need to talk with you to make this decision. If the graduate advisor/professor thinks that your course credit cannot be transferred and you insist on getting it transferred, then you need to take a challenge test (time/location agreed by both parties) and ask the professor to grade it. If you manage to get a B, then your course credit can be transferred.
