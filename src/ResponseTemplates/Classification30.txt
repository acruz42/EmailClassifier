Q: "I may need to be late to come to the university because I may not get my visa on time. What should I do?"

A: If you will be no more than two weeks later than the starting date of the semester, you can request a letter from the graduate advisor to support your late arrival by sending an email to gradcs@cs.nmsu.edu. If you will be much later, you are suggested to defer your admission semester because you may not be able to catch up your courses.
