Q: "When I try to register for a course, the system does not allow me to register, or maybe the course is closed, what should I do?"

A: Please contact the course instructor (not the graduate advisor) who will be teaching that course to ask for approval. Please note that if you do not meet the course prerequisites, the course instructor (not the graduate advisor) decides whether you are allowed to take that course or not.
