Q: "What is the deadline to apply for your PhD and Masterâ€™s programs?"

A: There is no specific deadline for the applications. The department generally processes applications within about 1-2 weeks after we receive your complete application package and submit the recommendation to graduate school. The graduate school may take some time to issue the formal admission letter. The graduate school can be reached through email gradinfo@nmsu.edu.
