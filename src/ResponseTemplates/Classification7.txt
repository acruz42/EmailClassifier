Q: Your question was classfied as:  "I am new to the department. What classes should I take?"

A: Please contact the graduate advisor to ask for suggestions about which courses to take. Not every course is offered every semester. Thus, if you are new to the department, you are encouraged to talk with the general graduate advisor first.
