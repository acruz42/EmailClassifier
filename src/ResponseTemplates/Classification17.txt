Q: "How can my referees send their recommendation letters?"

A: When you submit your applications on line, you need to submit the names and email addresses of three referees. Once you provide your refereesâ€™ information, your referees will automatically receive an email from our system. They can use the link in the email to upload your recommendation letters.

Please do NOT send any hardcopy of the recommendation letters (if not requested). Please do NOT email your recommendation letters (if not requested).
