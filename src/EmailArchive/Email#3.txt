Body:
Ma'am, i am really interested to join New Mexico State University. However,=
 without any financial support it is not possible for me to do my MS at NMS=
U. So, I humbly request you to provide me TA. Furthermore, I have teaching =
as well as working experience in the field of Computer Science. Therefore, =
in my master period i will give my full effort to convince you. Also, I wan=
t to promise you that i won't let you down in respect to my academic perfor=
mances.

If you want to check either i am capable or not for TA,  you can take my in=
terview for confirmation.

That you very much for your time and consideration.
I'm waiting for your response.
